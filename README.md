# BT2201 Task HTML Links

## Introduction

### Overview

Just like in the previous task you will add some content to a very basic HTML document. This time the initial HTML document is called 'links.html'. It can be found in this repository. 

### Editing

#### The quick way...

If you like you can edit the document directly in GitHub's web interface. This is a very convenient way of editing the file, but this approach will make it difficult to keep the files on bimserver2 and in GitHub in sync.  

If you want to have a quick look whether your HTML files look ok you can check by using the HTML preview site http://htmlpreview.github.io/? - simply add http://htmlpreview.github.io/? before the URL of your HTML file.   

#### The preferred way...

The preferred way of working is to edit the files on your own machine. 

To get the repository to your own machine you can use GitHub Desktop or link your GitHub account to PHPStorm (there are many more ways but these two are very convenient).

* You then upload these files to bimserver2 for testing.
* You commit changes and push the commits to create a history of the changes over time.
* You can work on several machines and use commits as a way of keeping the files on different machines up to date. 

## Task

Below is today's task. You have to start this work in the 'links.html' file. It can be found in the same repository as the text you are currently reading. As you will need to link to other files might want to create additional files in your repository.   

Show that you can use the following HTML elements by creating a set of documents that use using them in a meaningful way: 

* Internal/external links
* Absolute/relatives links
* Links that open in the same / in a different window
* Comments, horizontal rules


* ☞Add the final URL on bimserver2.com to the comment at the top of your files.  
* ☞Give the page(s) a meaningful title (`<title></title>`).
* ☞Upload the file(s) to your area on bimserver2.com
* ☞Content, file and folder names (except links.html) are up to you.
* ☞Upload the file(s) to your area on bimserver2.com.

You are welcome to copy and paste HTML from these handouts, but the quotes might need changing from opening double quotes (“) and closing double quotes (”) to straight double quotes ("). 
 
Commit early, commit often - that way you can go back if you have made a mistake and I can see all the work you have done. There's no problem if you commit and there's a mistake in your file.  

Once you are done be sure to commit your changes (that will save them to the repository) and to push them to GitHub (so that I can see the work you have done).

Work on this task by yourself, not in groups.
